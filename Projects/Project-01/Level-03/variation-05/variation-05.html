 <!--I splashed some colores from a tumbler
and smeared the drab world with emotion.
            I charted on a dish of jelly
    the jutting cheekbones of the ocean.
         Upon the scales of tin salmon
        I read the calls of lips yet mute.
                        And you, 
                       could you 
            have played a nocturne
          with just a drainpipe for a 
                           flute?!-->
